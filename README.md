Correlation dimension (GP, GKA and Judd's algorithm) and various surrogate algorithms in MATLAB

```dimension/``` contains various tools to estimate correlation dimension using a variety of standard tools from the dynamical systems literature
```invariants/``` are a bunch of invariant - or somewhat invariant - nonlinear measures estimable from time series
```surrogates/``` an assortment of surrogate generation algorithms

Currently untested with current version of MATLAB and not for general distribution.

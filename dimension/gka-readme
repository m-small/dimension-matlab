GKA
Gaussian Kernel Algorithm Correlation Dimension Estimation

Estimatation of correlation dimension, entropy and noise level using the
GKA algorithm.

INSTALLATION

- Place the contents of this archive in a directory on MATLAB's search
path.
- Compile the mex functions. On recent versions of MATLAB,
>> mex interbinref.c
>> mex interbin.c
should be sufficient. Older versions may require you to run mex -setup
first. If you know nothing about mex files, start by reading the help.
- run test.m

USAGE

See individual help files and example in test.m

DISCLAIMER

Estimating invariants from noisy time series can be risky. Do *not*
trust the output of this algorithm blindly. Any liability or problems
caused are yours!
